## Problem Domain
1. Write a function that takes in a string with a number of braces in it. Check if the number of end braces matches the number of start braces, and if the ordering of the braces are correct. Use a stack for this problem.

2. Write a function that takes in a sorted array and a value n. Return which index of the array, if any, that the value is contained. Use a binary search for this function.
