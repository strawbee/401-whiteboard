## Problem Domain
We are writing a function takes in an object. The object has two key-value pairs, the first being a 'value': [numeric value], and the second being a 'next': [another object with the same key-value pairs]. The illustration at hand is that we must traverse through a train, starting from the head (the engine) all the way to the tail (the caboose). The value at each car (linked object) of the train is the number of passengers in the car. The goal is to console.log the number of passengers on each car.
